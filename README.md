# LIRI - Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface

LIRI Bot is a command line node app that takes in parameters and returns data. Twitter and Spotify NPM packages are used to get that respective data. Request NPM package is used to access the OMDB API. FS NPM package is used for reading and writing to local files. API keys are obfuscated by containing them in an external file, and excluded from github upload.
